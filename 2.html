Experts on the science of success know that the brain is a goal-seeking organism.
Whatever personal goals you give to your subconscious mind, it will work night and day to achieve them.

However, one goal isn’t good enough. Some goals take longer to achieve than others
and if you spend years working toward only one objective, you’re likely to get
discouraged when it doesn’t happen right away.
